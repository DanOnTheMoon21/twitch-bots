# twitch-bots

These are my personal one-off twitch bots. I haven't put much effort into them, and they should not be used for production purposes. On top of them, I have leveraged [Vorpal](https://vorpal.js.org/) to manage them.

These bots should not be used in a twitch channel without the permission of the broadcaster. Some of them can be especially annoying to the viewers and/or broadcasters.

I do not condone the improper usage of these bots, especially, if the implementation of the bot breaks Twitch's Terms of Service. Nor am I responsible for their usage outside of my own personal use.

For all of the above, I have not included a how-to for this repo, but I cannot prevent people from reverse engineering the code here or building bots based off the same fundamental principles.
